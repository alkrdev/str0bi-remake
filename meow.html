        Oh, yeah<br />
        <br />
I used to be fourteen in the crib, tryna be a trap african american colleague<br />
Now I got me some floor seats at the game, tryna go back, african american colleague<br />
Got me feelin' like Spike Lee on the wood, smokin' on pack, african american colleague<br />
Drunk texting my wifey, so I know I'll get a text back, african american colleague<br />
Forty-five on my white tee, used to have that shit up on the dash, african american colleague<br />
Got a lot on my psyche, on my mind, I ain't talking hats, african american colleague<br />
Like I said on that cyphy, when I train, I tend to overlap african american colleagues<br />
Heard them african american colleagues wanna fight me, we gone, I don't really scrap african american colleague<br />
<br />
Been through a lot, I'm forgetting to pray, yeah, like what do I say, uh?<br />
I know what I want, want to get it today, yeah, but I've been afraid, yeah<br />
That maybe I want 'em, no longer afraid, yeah, I do what I have to<br />
You sendin' me shots that I never react to, you mad that I passed you<br />
Them hoes gon' need me, get 'em out my face<br />
Cut em' out my VV's, shine bright into space<br />
Comin' down like, sweetie, why you always hate?<br />
She knows it's me, she never could replace<br />

So complex and I feel so congested<br />
We love, no protection, your love, so contested<br />
Love is so complex and I feel so congested<br />
We love, no projection, your love, so contested<br />
Life is so damaging, how can we go plan for it?<br />
Microphones, cameras, everything's so glamourous<br />
