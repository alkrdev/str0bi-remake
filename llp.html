    <ul>
        <li>LLP is a Record Label that seeks underground artists from all around the music spectrum.</li>
        <li>We (well, I) don't take any monetary cuts from artists unless they make a lot of money.</li>
        <li>All rights for music signed with LLP are of the artists.</li>
        <li>But that's standard practices. What separates LLP from other labels?</li>
        <li>LLP has a (currently very limited) community, made up of "Divisions".</li>
        <li>These Divisions are based off genre, and will help artists find other people to work with.</li>
        <li>This project aims to connect artists directly, through Discord, and see music thrive.</li>
        <li>If you're interested in joining, more updates will be announced in the upcoming Discord server. You caught this project quite early.</li>
      </ul>
